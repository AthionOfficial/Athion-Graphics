# Athion-Graphics
## Scope
The reason we created this repository is to utilize the github offered free Fastly CDN caching of assets such as CSS, JS, and Imagery so that our sites can operate as rapidly as possible.

The benefit to doing something such as this is you can use github in budget hosted scenarios where you don't want your website to load like a snail but also don't want to spend a fortune getting top tier website responsiveness.

Eventually I'll add a script or something to automagically optimize images that have been imported into this repository using that [google image optimization tool](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/OptimizeImages) .
